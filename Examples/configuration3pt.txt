log-level: INFO 				# Only messages with log level INFO or higher are output.
log-out: LOG_BOTH				# Logs to stdout and log.log file.
result-folder: Examples/Configuration3pt	# Folder where results are stored (absolute or relative to current).
simulation-time: 1000				# Simulation time in hours.
patient-interval: 25				# Mean time between patients arriving.
random-seed: 3
number-of-runs: 20


# Number of units in each phase:
number-of-operation-units: 1
number-of-preparation-units: 4
number-of-recovery-units: 5

# Base service times:
base-preparation-time: 40
base-operation-time: 20
base-recovery-time: 40   


# Personal twist: different patient conditions.
# New conditions can be created by adding new parameters with the following format:
#
#      patient-condition-<NAME_OF_THE_CONDITION> : <VALUE>
#
# , where <VALUE> is array with the following elements:
#   - Severity level. Lower value has higher priorization and thus higher urgency.
#   - Portion of total generated patients. Sum of proportions is normalized to match 100%.
#   - Death rate. Probability for patient to die in elapsed time that is equilivalent with
#                 preparation time + operation time (when multipliers applied).
#   - Array of multipliers for base service times.
#
# For example value: [0, 0.10, 0.001, [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]] 
#
# , has highest priority of all, 10% probability that generated patient has this condition,
#   probability of death is 0.1% before operated (when no waiting),
#   preparation time is 10% of "base-preparation-time" parameter value, etc..
